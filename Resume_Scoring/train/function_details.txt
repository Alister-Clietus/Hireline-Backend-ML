Explanation:
Extract Text: Reads text from PDF files in the train folder.
Preprocess Text: Converts text to lowercase and removes special characters.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts the text data into numerical form.
Train-Test Split: Divides data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trains an SVM model with a linear kernel.
Evaluation: Calculates the Mean Squared Error to assess the model's performance.
Save Artifacts: Saves the vectorizer and model as .pkl files.
